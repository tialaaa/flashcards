# FlashCards

### Abstract:
Need to test your knowledge of Javascript's array prototype methods? Then you need this interative flash cards application! Using a command line interface, users can view multiple-choice questions, submit guesses, receive feedback, and see their final score and how long it took to complete the deck of 30 questions.

### Preview:


### Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- Mocha & Chai for test driven development
- MAC Terminal for testing

### Instructions:
- Clone this repo to your local machine: [FlashCards](https://github.com/tialaaa/flashcards)
- In the terminal, navigate into the repo's directory.
- Run `node index.js` to start the program. You will see a welcome message and the first question.
- Use keyboard arrow keys to select a guess and click return to submit. You will receive feedback and be prompted for the next question.
- Continue until you receive your final score.
- Repeat until you master the subject!

### Context:
Completed over three days during the beginning of module 2 at the Turing School. Goals for this project included
1) Implement a robust testing suite using TDD by writing tests for the first time.
2) Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application.
3) Write modular, reusable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle.
