# FlashCards

### Abstract:
This interative flash cards application allows users to test their knowledge of Javascript's array prototype methods using the command line interface. Users can view multiple-choice questions, submit guesses, and receive feedback for each guess. When the 30-question deck is complete, a message shows the final score and how long it took to complete the round.

- Repeat until you master the subject!

### Context:
Completed over three days during the beginning of module 2 at the Turing School. Goals for this project included:
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD by writing tests for the first time
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Write modular, reusable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle
